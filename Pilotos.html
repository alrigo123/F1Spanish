                            was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April, and 1 May 1994. Senna stayed in room no. 200

                            Alain Marie Pascal Prostis a retired French racing driver and a four-time Formula One Drivers' Champion. In 1999, 
                            Prost received the World Sports Award of the Century in the motor sport category.During the 1980s and early 1990s Prost formed a fierce sporting rivalry, mainly with Ayrton Senna 
                            but also Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two had a series of controversial clashes, 
                            including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship.

                            He won five world championships in the 1950s, not an era renowned for safety. He did it for four different teams – Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati – driving some of 
                            the most genuinely iconic racing cars in the history of the sport, and finished second twice. And while those were different times and far fewer races were run, Fangio’s hit rate is 
                            still extraordinary: 29 pole positions, 48 front row starts, 24 victories, from 51 championship Grands Prix starts. 
                            He was 46 when he won his last title, in 1957, a testament to his immense physical strength.

                            He still polarises opinion, and there’s no question that he over-stepped the mark more often than was necessary. To put it mildly. But Michael Schumacher remains an 
                            all-time great and not just because he won seven world championships, 91 races and smashed every record there was to smash. Or that he possessed the Senna-like ability to 
                            drive his car right on the limit, while being physically fit and intelligent enough to keep a good chunk of his mental firepower in reserve to manage tricky pit-wall calls.
